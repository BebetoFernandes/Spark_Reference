# Spark_Reference
Spark is a multi-language engine that can be used for executing data engineering, data science, and machine learning on single-node machines or clusters. You are going to need it when dealing with data in large scale where processing with pandas and python presents itself as an unproductive option. More detailed explanations are provided in the link below (Portuguese version, please contact me if you have any trouble reading it or need further assistance).

Although there are different usage examples of it, I am adding Spark in this step of Data Collection as all my previous experiences with the language were related to extracting and preparing the data for the next steps with Python or BI tools.
